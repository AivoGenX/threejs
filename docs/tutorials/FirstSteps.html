        <h3>First Steps</h3>

        Three.js scenes are very easy to setup and only require a few lines of code to initialize.<br/>
        Scenes are constructed using a few different types of objects: cameras, lights, and meshes.

        The first step in rendering a three.js scene is creating the WebGL renderer object.<br/>
        The following code creates an HTML canvas object 800x400 pixels,
        adds it to the document's body,and initializes a three.js scene.<br/>
        The second step is to define a camera which the renderer object will use in rendering.

        <pre>

	var camera = new THREE.PerspectiveCamera(
		35,			// Field of view
		window.innerWidth / window.innerHeight,	// Aspect ratio
		.1,			// Near
		10000		// Far
	);
	camera.position.set( -15, 10, 15 );

        </pre>

        The first parameter passed determines how wide the field of view is.<br/>
        The second parameter is the aspect ratio which is calculated by dividing<br/>
        the viewing area's width by its height. The third and fourth parameters specify 
        cut-off points for objects in the camera's view.<br/>
        If an object's distance from the camera does not fall in the range between NEAR and FAR
        then that object is not rendered.<br/>
        The last line sets the camera's XYZ coordinates to -15, 10, and 15 respectively.<br/>

        Step three creates a white cube that is 5 units wide, tall and deep,
        adds the Lambert material, and adds it to the scene.<br/>

        <pre>

	var cube = new THREE.Mesh(
		new THREE.CubeGeometry( 5, 5, 5 ),
		new THREE.MeshLambertMaterial( { color: 0xFF0000 } )
	);
	scene.addC( cube );

        </pre>

        For the last step in setting up a scene we create a yellow light source and add it to the scene.

        <pre>

	var light = new THREE.PointLight( 0xFFFF00 );
	light.position.set( 10, 0, 10 );
	scene.add( light );

        </pre>

        Finally we render the scene which displays our scene through the camera's eye.

        <pre>

	renderer.render(scene, camera);

        </pre>

        Everything together in a working example:

        <pre>
	
	window.onload = function() {
			
		var renderer = new THREE.WebGLRenderer();
		renderer.setSize( window.innerWidth, window.innerHeight );
		document.body.appendChild( renderer.domElement );
			
		var scene = new THREE.Scene();
				
		var camera = new THREE.PerspectiveCamera(
			35,		// Field of view
			window.innerWidth / window.innerHeight,	// Aspect ratio
			.1,		// Near
			10000		// Far
		);
		camera.position.set( -15, 10, 15 );
		
		var cube = new THREE.Mesh(
                        new THREE.CubeGeometry( 5, 5, 5 ),
                        new THREE.MeshLambertMaterial( { color: 0xFF0000 } )
		);
		scene.add( cube );
				
                var light = new THREE.PointLight( 0xFFFF00 );
		light.position.set( 10, 0, 10 );
		scene.add( light );
				
		renderer.render(scene, camera);
				
	};
        </pre>

        That's how simple and easy three.js makes WebGL.
        Only 20 lines of Javascript to initialize and render a scene.
