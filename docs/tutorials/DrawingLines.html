        <h3>Drawing Lines</h3>
        Lets say you want to draw a line or a circle, not a wireframe geometry.<br/>
        First we need to setup Renderer,Scene and camera (<a href="FirstSteps.html">see First Steps</a>)<br/>
        Here is the code that we will use for that in this tutorial.
        
        <pre>
        renderer = new THREE.WebGLRenderer();
        renderer.setSize(window.innerWidth, window.innerHeight);
        document.body.appendChild(renderer.domElement);
        camera = new THREE.PerspectiveCamera(45, window.innerWidth / window.innerHeight, 1, 500);
        camera.position.set(0, 0, 100);
        camera.lookAt(new THREE.Vector3(0, 0, 0));
        scene = new THREE.Scene();
        </pre>      
        
        Next thing we will do is define material.
        For lines we have to use LineBasicMaterial.
        
        <pre>
        var material = new THREE.LineBasicMaterial({
            color: 0x0000ff,
        });
        </pre>
        
        After material we will need a geometry.<br/>
        Lines are drawn:<br/>
        from geometry.vertices[0] to geometry.vertices[1],<br/>
        from geometry.vertices[1] to geometry.vertices[2],<br/>
        from geometry.vertices[2] to geometry.vertices[3],and so on.<br/>
        But not from the last to the first.
        
        
        <pre>
        var geometry = new THREE.Geometry();
        geometry.vertices.push(new THREE.Vertex(new THREE.Vector3(-10, 0, 0)));
        geometry.vertices.push(new THREE.Vertex(new THREE.Vector3(0, 10, 0)));
        geometry.vertices.push(new THREE.Vertex(new THREE.Vector3(10, 0, 0)));
        
        </pre>
        
        Now that we have points for two lines, and a material. We can put them together to form a line.
        
        <pre>
        var line = new THREE.Line(geometry, material);
        </pre>
        
        All thats left is to add it to the scene and call a render.
        
        <pre>
        scene.add(line);
        renderer.render(scene,camera);
        </pre>
        
        If everything is ok you shoud be seing a blue arrow(pointing up) made out of two lines.
