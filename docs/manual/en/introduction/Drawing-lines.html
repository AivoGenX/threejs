				When creating graphics with three.js, sometimes you might want to draw simple shapes like lines or circles, rather than wireframe [page:Mesh].
				First we need to set up the [page:WebGLRenderer renderer], [page:Scene scene] and [page:Camera camera] (see the Creating a scene page).
			</p>

			<p>Here is the code that we will use:</p>
			<h2>Setup</h2>
			<p>Begin by initializing the renderer, scene, and camera.</p>
			<code>
// Initialize the renderer
const renderer = new THREE.WebGLRenderer();
renderer.setSize( window.innerWidth, window.innerHeight );
document.body.appendChild( renderer.domElement );

// Set up the camera
const camera = new THREE.PerspectiveCamera( 45, window.innerWidth / window.innerHeight, 1, 500 );
camera.position.set( 0, 0, 100 );
camera.lookAt( 0, 0, 0 );

// Create the main scene
const scene = new THREE.Scene();
			</code>
			<h2>Create Material</h2>
			<p>For your lines, you'll need to define a material. You can choose between [page:LineBasicMaterial] or [page:LineDashedMaterial]. In this instance, we're going for a straightforward blue line.</p>
			<code>
//create a blue LineBasicMaterial
const material = new THREE.LineBasicMaterial( { color: 0x0000ff } );
			</code>

			<h2>Define Geometry</h2>
			<p>
				After material we will need a geometry with some vertices:
			</p>

			<code>
const points = [];
points.push( new THREE.Vector3( - 10, 0, 0 ) );
points.push( new THREE.Vector3( 0, 10, 0 ) );
points.push( new THREE.Vector3( 10, 0, 0 ) );

const geometry = new THREE.BufferGeometry().setFromPoints( points );
			</code>

			<p>Note: Lines connect each consecutive pair of vertices. However, the line doesn't circle back from the last to the first vertex, meaning it won't create a closed shape.</p>

			<h2>Construct the Line</h2>
			<p>Now that we have points for two lines and a material, we can put them together to form a line.</p>
			<code>
const line = new THREE.Line( geometry, material );
			</code>
			
			<h2>Render the Scene</h2>
			<p>All that's left is to add it to the scene and call [page:WebGLRenderer.render render].</p>

			<code>
scene.add( line );
renderer.render( scene, camera );
			</code>

			<p>You should now be seeing an arrow pointing upwards, made from two blue lines.</p>
