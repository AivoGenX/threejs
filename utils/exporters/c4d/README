Save script to your MAXON scripts directory - on OSX it's

   /Applications/MAXON/CINEMA 4D R12/library/scripts

Once you do that the script will magically show up in your Python/User Scripts menu. Select the object you want to export and then export using the script. Exported Three.js file is in the same directory as your C4D model.

Really just supports exporting objects with UV mapped textures at this point. As far as I can tell the C4D API doesn't expose any of the animation info..
