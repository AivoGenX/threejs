# Three.js end-to-end testing

### Motivation
Simplify code reviews with quick pixel testing inside CI. The same screenshots are used for thumbnails.

### Local usage
If you get an error in e2e test after PR and you sure that all is correct,
just make a new screenshot to example. As a last resort increase timeouts or add it to exception list.

```shell
# generate new screenshots for exact examples
npm run make-screenshot <example1_name> ... <exampleN_name>

# check exact examples
npm run test-e2e <example1_name> ... <exampleN_name>

# check all examples
npm run test-e2e
```

Merge only those commits that pass the tests, otherwise all next commits will also fail.

### How it works
- ci configs with parallelism
- deterministic random/timer/rAF/video for screenshots
- increased robustness with hided text, datgui, different flags and timeouts.
- pipeline: turn off rAF -> wait until page is loaded -> turn on rAF -> render
- use multiple attempts for robustness

### Status
TBD% examples are covered with tests. Check exception list for more information.
